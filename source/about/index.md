Hi, I'm Duarte. I'm a CS student and musician wannabe. I'm interested in software engineering, free/open source software and online privacy.

On my site, you can find:

- some of my [software projects](../projects)
- some references I like to keep handy:
    - [knowledge](../knowledge)
    - [services](../services)

**Notice**: Software migration in course, bugs ahead!
