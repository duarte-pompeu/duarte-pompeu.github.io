Hi, I'm Duarte. I have a Master's degree in Software Engineering, with majors in Intelligent Systems and Software Engineering. Sometimes I also make music, run, and cook.

This is my personal minimalistic website, using [pandoc](https://pandoc.org) and a simple build [script](./build.txt) (inspired by [this](http://wstyler.ucsd.edu/posts/pandoc_website.html)).
