Hi, I'm Duarte. I have a Master's degree in Software Engineering, with majors in Intelligent Systems and Software Engineering. I'm currently working as a backend and devops developer, which is why this website has the absolute minimum visual features :) Sometimes I also make music, run, and cook.

This is my personal minimalistic website, using [pandoc](https://pandoc.org) and a simple build [script](https://github.com/duarte-pompeu/duarte-pompeu.github.io/blob/master/build.sh) I programmed (inspired by [this](http://wstyler.ucsd.edu/posts/pandoc_website.html)). The goal was to avoid relying on external tools which sometimes broke and would kill my motivation to publish updates.

The deploying setup is a bit dirty, with both source code and html in the same git repo, but while not elegant, it is allows for simple updating.

(About breaking stuff: just had to reinstall pandoc and the same command does not generate the same output, breaking my css for the time being. Oh well, maybe I should make my own generator, or use a fixed version.)
