# DuartePompeu.com

Hi, I'm Duarte. I'm software engineer, cocktail enthusiast and lover of arts.

This website serves as a hub to some of my side projects:

- [My Bar](https://bar.duartepompeu.com)
- [Discover Albums for Spotify](https://discover-albums.duartepompeu.com/)

## Projects

[My Bar](https://bar.duartepompeu.com) has instructions for my favorites cocktails. It's organized according to different menus, depending on the ingredients I had available at different events. Technically, it's a frontend only website, implemented in SvelteKit and deployed in Netlify.

[Discover Albums for Spotify](https://discover-albums.duartepompeu.com/) expands your Discover Weekly playlist - instead of just having some new songs to listen, you have whole albums. Technically, it's a server-side rendered website, using FastAPI and Jinja templates, and deployed in fly.io.

## Meta

This website doesn't see much activity, but has gone through a lot of facelifts. First I had trouble re-building it after long pauses, especially due to my lack of knowledge in my early days, but now I build it according to a few custom scripts and pandoc, which is containerized and stricly versioned.

Some long term plans:

- write more
- support RSS
- support comments
