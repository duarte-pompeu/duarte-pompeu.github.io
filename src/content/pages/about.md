Title: About me

Hi, I'm Duarte. I'm a CS student and musician wannabe. 

You can find some of my software projects here.

I also keep a lot of references I find useful or interesting. It's useful to have them available everywhere,
all I need is a browser and internet connection.

**Notice**: I'm in the process of moving my old site to the pelican 'framework', so it may look incomplete for a while.
