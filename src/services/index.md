# Useful resources

Below are some resources which I find very useful and frequently access.

## Development

### APIs

- [Swagger editor](https://editor.swagger.io/): quickly check openapi files
- [Postman](https://www.postman.com/): test APIs with a better UX than Swagger (imo)

### Inspect HTTP requests: 

These allow you to inspect your HTTP requests, such as POST:

- [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/): secure introspectable tunnels to localhost
- [Webhook.site](https://webhook.site): saves requests and lets you inspect them
- [httpbin(1)](https://httpbin.org/): test requests. Simple, but provides a docker image to use locally. Try it with `docker run -p 80:80 kennethreitz/httpbin` 

### Others

- [Regex 101](https://regex101.com/): learn and validate regex

## Linux

## Music

- [Who Sampled](https://www.whosampled.com/): discover the samples used in a song, or songs which sampled it

## Typing

Quick typing is a hobby of mine, and my personal record was 115 WPM (words per minute). 

This was back when I was using 3 fingers on each hand. Now I'm trying the *proper* style 
using all fingers, and I'm able to reach around 90 WPM. 
Decades olds habbits are pretty hard to break!
