## Learning how to learn

Incredible course for meta-learning.

## 30 days of Postman

[30 days of Postman - for developers](https://www.postman.com/postman/workspace/30-days-of-postman-for-developers/overview)

Good course to learn Postman with an interesting idea: it's 100% contained in a Postman collection!

It also has automatic testing, which is great. At the end of each lesson you can assure your code works. At the of all 30 lessons, you open a PR: if all tests pass, you get a badge!

The part that sucks is... it's 100% contained in a Postman collection. The UX isn't great, and half of my effort was fighting the UI.
